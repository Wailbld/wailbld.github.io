## Description
This project is a walkthrough of how I created an Active Directory home lab Environment using VMWare. I set up a Microsoft Server to run Active Directory on it. I then configure a Domain Controller that will allow me to run a domain. After that I ran a Powershell script to create over 100 users in Active Directory and proceed to log into those newly created accounts on another client that uses the domain I set up to connect to the internet. This lab simulates a business environment. In this lab I'll need a Microsoft Server 2019 ISO, A Windows 10 Enterprise ISO, VMWare and a Powershell script.


## Environments Used
 - VMware Pro

_Our Network Lab_


I'll assume you have VMWare or VirtualBox running and prior knowledge of setting up VM's, but I'll still go over the basics. Click to create a new virtual machine and select your Windows Server 2019 iso that was previously downloaded. This will be our domain controller!

## Configure VMware Netwok Adapters
Go to `Edit > Virtual Network Editor` than click `Change Settings`

![Desktop View](network-adapter.png){: width="500" height="300"}

![Desktop View](network-adapter2.png){: width="500" height="300"}

## Create Our Virtual Machine

Click on `Create a new virtual machine`,   Then, choose the Costume (Advanced) option than click  `Next`.

![Desktop View](1-opening-vmware.png){: width="500" height="300"}

![Desktop View](1.2-option.png){: width="500" height="300"}

We choose to ignore selecting the server image file iso to save our time from skipping some steps.

![Desktop View](2-install-operating-system-later.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Here we choose our Guest Operating system as windows Server 2019.

![Desktop View](3-choose-windows.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Next, we customize the VM “Hardware Specifications”. Since we are setting up a server with a heavier workload than a regular workstation, we will allocate two (2) virtual processors to ensure the server performs at a reasonable speed.

![Desktop View](4-choose-cpu-num.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Here we specify the amount of memory for our Domain controller machine , I think `3Gb` is good to go.

![Desktop View](5-dc01-memory.png){: width="500" height="300"}

For our disk size `60Gb` is by default , if you don't have that much space you can minimize it to `40Gb`.

![Desktop View](6-choose-disk-space.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Before launching our machine go to `Edit Virtual machine Settings` than select windows server 2019 iso file from you local host. 

![Desktop View](7-choose-your-server-iso.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Another thing we change our network adapter to `VMnet11`

![Desktop View](8-choose-network-adapter.png){: width="500" height="300"}

## Install Windows Server 2019

Clicking "Next" after starting our windows server machine will bring up the Operating System Wizard. To begin the installation process, click "Install Now." The following step will present four install choices, with two being labeled as "Desktop Experience" for a complete graphical experience. Choosing the second option, "Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)," is what we will do.

![Desktop View](9-choose-standard.png){: width="500" height="300"}

> The Standard edition is designed for small-to-medium-sized organizations that need no more than two instances of the server software in a virtual operating system.
{: .prompt-info }

The next steps are the same when you installing a windows os in virtual machine, When it is done, you will be presented with the “Customized Settings” screen to set up the local built-in Administrator password.

Click on the button in red square to unlock.

## Configure Windows Server Network

After logging into the server, we will start configuring a few things before installing Active Directory Services.
In search bar search for  `Settings` than click `Network & Internet`.

![Desktop View](12-settings.png){: width="500" height="300"}

![Desktop View](13-choose-networks.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Click `Change adapter options`.

![Desktop View](14-change-network.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Go to `Ethernet0 > Properties`.

![Desktop View](15-change-propertie.png){: width="500" height="300"}

check `Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4` than click on Properties.

![Desktop View](16-change-ipv4.png){: width="500" height="300"}
since we dont need internet for our lab, I decided to have the Host only network in the 172.16.0.0/24 range. Therefore, I assigned the server an IP address of 172.16.0.2 and a subnet mask address of “255.255.255.0”.
Also for the DNS, we assign it the DC address, which is a loopback of 127.0.0.1 so it pings itself.

![Desktop View](17-set-dc-network.png){: width="500" height="300"}

## Change Windows Server Name & Time Zone

Now we need to change our computer name to `DC01` , to do that click on `Computer name` in `Server Manager`.

![Desktop View](18-server-manager.png){: width="500" height="300"}

After changing our computer name a windows pop-up shows up asking to restart our machine , click `ok`.

![Desktop View](19-set-domain-dc01.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Changing the "Time Zone" to its location is an optional step. While it is not necessary to change the Time Zone, but it is important to ensure that the server Time and Date are configured. This is especially important because the server will be `promoted` as a domain controller. Having the server time and workstations in sync is essential for the proper functioning of the Kerberos protocol, which issues tickets for authentication.

## Take Snapshot

> Before configuring Active Directory, it is very important to have a Snapshot of the current state of the VM. This caution allow us instantly reverte our machine to initial state of the VM if any step goes wrong during the process. Snapshots allow you to easily restore to a previous state and then resume your development, allowing you to troubleshoot and recover.
{: .prompt-warning }
Go to `VM > Snapshot > Snapshot Manager`.

![Desktop View](21-take-snapshot.png){: width="500" height="300"}

Click on `Take Snapshot` and write something related to the state of machine.

That’s all for this post. In the next post, we will work on installing the Active Directory services and configuring our vulnerable Active Directory lab.
